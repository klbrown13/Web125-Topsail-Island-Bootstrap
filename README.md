# Web125-Topsail-Island-Bootstrap

Create another version of the Topsail Beach NC Website (Opens in new window) URL: https://topsailbeachnc.gov/Visitors/Things-To-Do  this time, using Bootstrap.  
As you already made many of the executive editing decisions regarding content in the previous project, this assignment should be mostly a question of using Bootstrap for layout.  If you wish, rather than a redesign, you can create your own beach town Website inspired by the link above. 
Your final product should contain at least 5 functioning links (internal links to sections of a single-page site is fine) and cater to the relevant target audiences.

The end product should be:

    HTML5 compliant (10%)
    Visually appealing, using the principles of good design (15%)
    Offer a excellent UX with both full and mobile version (ultimately incorporating responsive design via Bootstrap) (20%)
    Appropriate, accessible colors (10%)
    Fully functional navigation with at least five links (15%)
    Content is relevant and caters to its target market (10%)
    Passes W3C Validation (10%)
    Briefly describe your experience using Bootstrap.  How does it compare to CSS Grid? (10%)

Note:  You can use stock photos that you find on the Internet, providing you are not violating any copyright.
**Note that, only the basic, free Bootstrap templates (opens in new window) URL: https://startbootstrap.com/templates?showPro=false  are acceptable for use; downloading and using a professionally designed theme and merely swapping out content will be considered cheating!
