                     The Parks and Recreation Board, with the help of consultant Dr. James
                     Herstine, is working to update the Comprehensive Parks and Recreation Master
                     Plan. One of the first steps in updating the plan is to hear from YOU -
                     our valuable property owners and residents! We are calling on volunteers
                     who want to participate through an individual interview or focus group.
                     The time commitment is minimal, with interviews expected to last about
                     1 hr and the focus group about 2-3 hrs. If you would like to volunteer
                     in helping us as we update the Comprehensive Parks and Recreation Master
                     Plan, fill out our volunteer survey

                  <p>
                     The Army Corp of Engineers has released their FALL 2023 surveys of many
                     local inlets, including Topsail Inlet. These surveys are intended to monitor
                     the natural shoaling of inlets caused by tidal waters. They are also useful
                     for safe boating as they can be used for navigational purposes as well.
                     However, it is important to remember that the surface under the water is
                     constantly changing so while the surveys released today are relative now,
                     please check back for the most current surveys.
