                  Situated at the southern end of Topsail Island, off the coast of southeastern
                  North Carolina, the Town of Topsail Beach is the smallest of the three
                  communities located on the 26-mile long island. North Topsail Beach occupies
                  the northernmost section, and Surf City, the largest town on the island,
                  is in the center. The Island is just off US Highway 17, about half-way
                  between Wilmington and Jacksonville. Topsail Island has a rich and varied
                  history. <br><br>Although folklore has it that the island was named Topsail (pronounced
                  Tops'l) because pirate ships hid behind the island with their topsails
                  visible from the sea, the name came from New Topsail Inlet. This inlet's
                  name can be found on early navigational charts with the other Topsail Inlet
                  located in Beaufort, N.C. Soon after J.G. Anderson developed the southernmost
                  end of the island and named it New Topsail Beach, the island has been called
                  Topsail.

                  Prior to World War II, the only access to Topsail Island was by boat.
                  Area residents frequently made this short trip and picnicked on the sandy
                  shores of the Atlantic Ocean. Local farmers are said to have driven their
                  livestock across the waterways to graze on wild grass.

                  Treasure hunters searched for Blackbeard’s infamous buried treasure throughout
                  the maritime forests which covered the island. During the early part of
                  the 1900's a few structures, less than a dozen, were built along the sound
                  and were used as shelter for fishing trips and summer vacations.

                  Immediately after the war, the Navy took possession of the island and
                  began a joint project with Johns Hopkins University known as Operation
                  Bumblebee which was an early guided missile development program. Over 200
                  missiles were test fired. The missile assembly building is located on the
                  sound at Channel Blvd. and Flake Ave. in the Topsail Beach business district
                  which is now used as a museum and meeting center. <br><br><br>The launch pad is used
                  as a patio for the Jolly Roger Motel. Several missile tracking towers still
                  stand along the island. The testing program was dismantled in 1948 and
                  the island was given back to the original owners. The roads and bridge
                  were left intact and so began the development of the island.
